* About OpenFOAM
  OpenFOAM is a free, open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software
  package released by the OpenFOAM Foundation. It has a large user base across
  most areas of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic
  organisations. OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve anything
  from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat
  transfer, to solid dynamics and electromagnetics.

* Solidification Developments
  This repository contains developments for modeling columnar solidification of
  binary alloys contributed by John Coleman at Purdue University to the OpenFOAM
  Foundation that are being evaluated and not yet included the main OpenFOAM-dev
  repository.

  This work includes a solver based on the continuum mixture theory presented
  in:

  W.D. Bennon and F.P. Incropera,
  "A continuum model for momentum, heat and species transport
  in binary solid-liquid phase change systems - 1. Model formulation",
  IJHMT 30 (1987) 2161-2170.

  as well as a test case for the well-known SMACS numerical benchmark:
